// Could not find a declaration file for module 'react/jsx-runtime'.
//  implicitly has an 'any' type.
//  If the 'react' package actually exposes this module, consider sending a pull request to amend 'https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/tree/master/types/react`

//  THIS IS NOT AN ISSUE WITH create-react-app; The typings for @types/react@17.x.x are not released yet and need to address this issue.

// Till the time they aren't released this hack work & should be removed when types are available.

// declare module 'react/jsx-runtime' {
// 	export default any;
// }
